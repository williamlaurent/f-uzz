Fuzzing Websites to Find Juicy Informations.
#
There are many free bots on GitHub, such as website fuzzing tools. I share them using lists, whether it's a list of files, a list of URLs, or a list of results. Feel free to recode and develop them, but don't forget to give credit and link back to my GitHub.
# Usage
python3 f-uzz.py | fill the list.txt with your url lists.
# One shot
python3 f-uzz.py && cat results.txt
